# Architecture and spatial contract

SwiftUI views use a main-actor Store for cloud/local records and errors. Backend owns Supabase authentication and requests; URLSession is injected for tests. ARController owns one ARView/session and the scan → draw transition. Pure value types own spatial validation, scan readiness and alignment calculations. The current workflow uses unconfigured local Debug storage and file transfer; no backend is connected. No reconstruction pipeline or realtime layer is involved.

## Coordinates and persistence

Positions are metres in ARKit's right-handed gravity-aligned coordinates. Pose is a column-major 16-float rigid matrix, rejecting scale, reflections and non-finite values. Room data uses spatial_version 1 and an immutable coordinate_id.

- During a new scan, the AR session frame is the room frame. A named `SiteAR.room.<coordinate_id>` anchor at identity is included in the saved ARWorldMap.
- Instructions store roomFromAnnotation plus local vertices. Areas/lines/arrows are real 3D geometry.
- A detected surface stores its ARPlaneAnchor pose and boundary vertices. The optional surfaces field is backward-compatible with older local JSON and is added to cloud rooms by migration 002.
- Saving the scan archives its map and publishes room metadata. The manager continues drawing in that SAME session with an identity room-to-session transform; no second recognition attempt is needed.
- On a revisit, initialWorldMap attempts to recover the saved coordinates. Only a restored matching room anchor, at least two seconds of normal tracking, and extending/mapped world-map evidence allow automatic recovery. Loading a file alone is insufficient.
- Rendering multiplies sessionFromRoom × roomFromAnnotation. Placement converts session-space raycasts with inverse(sessionFromRoom).

Automatic map recovery no longer requires selecting manual dots or tapping confirmation. It uses ARKit's tracking/relocalization evidence, not an assertion of survey accuracy. Users should inspect drawings against the real room, especially before consequential work. Tracking loss hides annotations and starts another recognition attempt. Failed recognition never falls back to an arbitrary identity origin. Sessions time out after 40 seconds and expose continued searching without resetting the AR session, plus an explicit restart. Existing sparse maps remain sparse; no mesh or arbitrary identity transform is used to pretend recognition succeeded.

## Live scanning feedback

ARPlaneAnchor add/update/remove events drive thin boundary outlines in RealityKit, with no filled surface meshes, plus surface counts and an animated, shaded SwiftUI Canvas miniature of thin 3D surface slabs. Merged/removed planes are removed from the overview. Readiness requires normal tracking stable for two seconds, mapped status, at least one detected plane, and multi-view movement evidence: all four horizontal heading sectors plus three observed positions at least 0.5 m apart. Observations count only with normal tracking and extending/mapped status. ScanCoverage is pure, bounded and reset with the map session; it is not a reconstruction or feature-visibility proof. This is readiness to save a useful spatial reference, not a percentage of the room scanned.

Initial placement and Lock view use existingPlaneGeometry only, bounded to 0.15–5 m; no silent estimatedPlane fallback is allowed. The targeted plane is highlighted in mint before a drawing is locked, with orientation/distance in the editor. Explicit measured-distance placement follows the actual crosshair ray instead of the camera forward vector. Boundary simplification tolerance is 5 mm, retaining smaller detected corners. These changes do not remove camera-only plane estimation error or AR tracking drift.

The scan overlay prioritizes the camera with plain Cancel/Finish, a short coaching capsule and a floating miniature. Surface counts, direction/position evidence and map readiness live in the Options sheet. It never reports a fabricated coverage percentage.

Plane alignment distinguishes vertical/horizontal candidates, not semantic walls/furniture. The overview projects real boundary geometry; it is not a generated miniature building. The app does not require RoomPlan or LiDAR. Scene depth is optional when supported. No Gaussian Splatting, furniture classification or 3D export is implemented.

## Drawing

The creation toolbar exposes drawing, area and image only. Legacy pin/text/arrow records remain readable. A FreehandDraft owns separate paths: touch-down begins, lift/cancel ends, and a single-point tap is discarded. A 3 mm sampling threshold and caps of 32 paths, 256 samples/path and 2,048 total bound storage/rendering. Two Chaikin passes smooth each path independently; RealityKit renders a round tube mesh per path. Areas use tapped coplanar corners without vertex dots. Undo removes one whole stroke.

Images are imported through PhotosPicker or the file picker, normalized with ImageIO to a maximum 2,048-pixel dimension, then saved as PNG in private project/room assets before the annotation record. The record stores path plus physical width/height, preserving aspect ratio. RealityKit uses a two-sided textured quad; frozen editing perspective-warps the same image to the selected plane. Missing assets report an error while the conventional task list stays available. Migration 003 adds optional image/strokes fields; older single-path records decode unchanged.

The bottom Save bar stays outside the scrollable tools. Work details and measured-distance inputs use native forms in sheets to keep the keyboard away from AR controls. Saved entity collisions allow task selection; scan overlays have no selectable collision geometry.

## Current recovery and compatibility

Native ARWorldMap recovery is the only active room-localization method. Physical-marker capture, image detection, marker printing and manual reference-point recovery were removed from the current flow. Legacy `marker`, `reference_points` and `reference_notes` JSON fields remain decodable; their presence does not enable a fallback. Existing pure transform math/tests do not imply that a removed recovery UI is active. Measured-distance placement remains explicit and only positions a drawing after room alignment; it cannot localize a saved room.

Cloud Anchors and Immersal are researched future alternatives. No provider SDK, credentials or hosting/resolving pipeline is integrated. See the [localization decision](decisions/0001-marker-free-shared-localization.md).

## Local storage and file transfer

Unconfigured iOS Debug builds start empty and save JSON, real ARWorldMaps and instruction images in Application Support. No backend connection, login or sample project is required for the current test. Local JSON and asset writes are atomic. Deleting the app deletes its local files. Release builds still require backend configuration; use a local Debug installation on each technician phone.

Project details exposes **Export project** through the native share sheet (AirDrop/Save to Files). The Projects dashboard exposes **Import project**; opening a `.sitear` file also invokes import. An export includes only the chosen project's rooms, annotations and referenced map/image assets. Inactive legacy marker images are excluded.

`ProjectTransferArchive` writes a single file: eight-byte `SITEAR01` magic, a little-endian UInt64 manifest length, UTF-8 Codable manifest and raw asset bytes in sorted path order. Assets stream through FileHandle in chunks of at most 1 MiB with CryptoKit SHA256; there is no base64 asset payload or archive-framework dependency. Limits are 16 MiB manifest, 256 MiB per asset, 1 GiB total assets, 256 rooms, 2,000 annotations and 100,000 geometry points including surfaces/strokes/reference points.

The codec validates the version, project/room/task associations, unique IDs, spatial validation and exact referenced asset list. Paths must be safe ASCII relative paths under their project UUID/room UUID prefix. Symbolic-link assets, missing files, digest mismatch, truncation, trailing bytes and exceeded limits fail. Export uses a temporary sibling file followed by a move; extraction uses a fresh sibling staging directory and rolls back on failure. Existing output files/directories are never overwritten.

Import validates/extracts before committing a project. It creates new project, room and annotation IDs and rewrites asset paths, while preserving room `coordinate_id`, map anchor identity, poses, vertices, strokes and image dimensions. The imported project is a separate editable copy. Reimporting an edited export creates another copy; it does not merge or synchronize task status with the source. A file's integrity check does not establish sender identity or provide server authorization. There is no live sync or remote revocation.

Maps themselves use secure NSKeyedArchiver archives with ARWorldMap-restricted unarchiving. File transfer preserves their coordinate relationship; successful extraction is not evidence that another phone can physically recover the map. The [README transfer procedure](../README.md#transfer-a-project-to-the-technician-without-a-backend) describes the pending two-phone acceptance.

## Deferred cloud access

Supabase authentication/client, migrations, RLS and private Storage code remain in the repository, but no backend has been connected for this local workflow. The existing design assigns an owner/manager and worker memberships; foreign keys bind annotations to room coordinate revisions, and published map/coordinate metadata is immutable. These are implementation properties awaiting live policy/account acceptance, not protections on an exported file. Local projects are not automatically uploaded.

The existing cloud client uses Keychain WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly and a shared in-flight refresh task. Cloud sync has no realtime conflict resolution/revocation. Activating or configuring a backend is deferred; local export/import does not satisfy the course cloud requirement.

Drafts survive tracking resets while the AR screen remains open; process termination loses unsaved work. Backgrounding a new scan restarts scanning; revisiting a saved room requires recovery. Keep physical-device Device Hub screen viewing OFF during camera testing: Apple blocks camera/mic access while it is active.

## Stable drawing

The first successful placement fixes a drawing-plane pose in ROOM coordinates. Later screen rays intersect that same plane instead of reraycasting independently against shifting estimates. Annotation poses retain this plane orientation, with vertices transformed into its local XY coordinates. Images and legacy text retain the selected surface orientation.

Lock view captures ARView's actual camera/scene snapshot and the matching camera view/projection matrices. A Canvas editing overlay projects real room-space draft vertices onto the frozen image. Gestures unproject against the captured camera matrix and intersect the locked plane. ARSession keeps tracking underneath; interruption/tracking loss releases the editing snapshot. Saved output remains normal RealityKit 3D geometry, not a persistent image overlay. Snapshot/projection capture timing and physical tracking accuracy still need hardware validation.

Legacy arrows retain their shaft and triangular head. Freehand line/area control points are not rendered in walkthroughs, and scan guides default off there. Lock view does not guarantee removal of ARKit world-tracking drift. The app's UI remains portrait.

## Scan visualization

RealityKit keeps at most 24 nearby outline anchors, each with one batched edge mesh and one halo, rather than per-edge entities/animations. New outlines use a native RealityKit 0.45-second opacity fade on iOS 18+ (immediate display on iOS 17); no CPU-stepped boundary trace is used. Geometry updates remain coalesced and unchanged geometry reuses its mesh. Camera tracking remains ARKit-driven. Metadata is capped at 128 patches with 64 ordered display samples each; rendering uses at most 24 samples. Display selection does not gate actual raycasts: a separate four-target stability cache handles active placement even outside the metadata cache. Degenerate refinements remove old drawables instead of leaving stale outlines.

The miniature caches world-space geometry for at most 24 patches with 12 samples each, computes trigonometry once per draw and depth once per face, and sorts scalar depths. RoomSurfaceModel conservatively consolidates near-coplanar overlapping patches for this miniature only, with bounded candidates and conservative observed-coverage checks. It does not create a full room mesh or infer semantic walls, windows or furniture. Original ARKit raycast patches, map coordinates and annotation poses remain unchanged. While animating, the miniature targets 60 Hz for up to eight surfaces and 30 Hz otherwise. It is static when settled, under reduced-detail pressure or with Reduce Motion. These scheduling targets are not measured phone FPS. ScanVisualization adds thin shaded faces to observed patches only; it does not invent room topology or alter annotation geometry.

A memory-warning observer or serious/critical thermal state switches to a 12-outline/no-halo renderer and reduced-detail miniature. Only visualization resources are released; the ARWorldMap, annotation records and room coordinate contract remain intact. This reduces bounded app-side work but cannot cap ARKit's internal feature-map memory or establish the cause of a device crash without diagnostics.

The local Floor Planner project is a separate 2D web planner and supplies no AR detection pipeline. Apple's RoomCaptureView/RoomCaptureSession are the relevant reference for the promotional video, but their semantic capture requires LiDAR; this visualization update does not add RoomPlan or a reconstruction pipeline.

## Camera-only tracking quality and placement gates

TrackingQuality contains deterministic tracking-advice states, SurfaceStability and CameraCaptureQuality. ARCamera tracking reasons select specific instructions. Initial raycast placement requires an existing plane whose normal/depth has settled for 0.6 seconds (within 2 cm and 3 degrees against a reference observation); tangential anchor-origin shifts do not reset that evidence. This is a heuristic for refinement, not physical accuracy/confidence. Manual measured distance remains explicit.

The freeze callback compares the captured and current camera pose, rejecting movement over 2 cm or basis-axis changes over 2 degrees, rather than accepting a stale camera/projection pair. Active strokes end on tracking loss and lifecycle interruption. Scene content is still hidden until alignment recovers. The session delegate opts into continued relocalization while running; saved rooms retain timed recovery/restart actions, and new scans have a confirmed restart action. Published tracking flags/guidance update only when changed, and surface visibility refreshes with events/status changes rather than every camera frame. No device FPS improvement is claimed without profiling. Autofocus is explicitly enabled (ARKit already enables it by default).

## Qualified scan observations and map-save sessions (27 October 2026)

ScanCoverage requires a continuous 0.75-second pause in one horizontal heading sector, with at most 0.35 m horizontal displacement from the candidate viewpoint and no observation gap over one second. Completed direction/position evidence is bounded and retained after tracking loss; unfinished evidence resets. A qualified view can add a position separated by at least 0.5 m from prior positions. The controller qualifies samples only with normal tracking, mapped/extending status and at least 20 raw tracking feature points. This threshold is a conservative coaching heuristic, not calibrated map confidence or proof that a wall is covered. Finish additionally requires mapped status, two seconds of normal tracking and a detected surface.

SurfaceStability expires one second after its last observation and restarts after gaps. Controller tracking loss clears both placement and plane stability caches, so a pre-interruption surface cannot immediately grant placement. Unusable boundary refinements remove cached geometry, drawables and placement evidence; losing the saved room sentinel hides instructions and requires recovery again.

MapSaveTransaction owns map bytes and pending publication for exactly one AR coordinate origin. Reset, interruption, suspension, session failure and stop invalidate its generation. Each asynchronous map-capture/upload response checks that generation before mutating or publishing state. A publication response that already succeeded is handled separately: it never identity-aligns the new session or claims the room is unsaved. The screen switches to a non-aligned saved-room state and directs the user to close/reopen. Unknown network outcomes still require reconciliation on reopening; no distributed transaction or automatic rollback of a successful backend write is claimed.
